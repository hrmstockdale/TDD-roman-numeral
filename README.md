- Practising TDD making a function converting numbers to roman numerals
- See romanizerWithCommentedCode.js to better how the function developed whilst iterating through a red-green-refactor flow

# core learning

- transformations that frequent TDD e.g, generalizing and if condition to a for/while
- how building small case-by-case with tests provides
  - security: I can be secure knowing that my code accounts for the cases slowly accruing in my tests
  - clarity: red-green often leads to refactor as opportunities for generalization are in front of you, a situation more opportune for spotting patterns.
